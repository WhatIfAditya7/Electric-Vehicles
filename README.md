#   Powering the Roads: An Comprehensive Analysis on Electric Vehicle <br>
Using Databricks and PySpark to Analyze and Predict the Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle Status of electric car and best conditions to drive in. <br>
# Abstract <br>
The goal of this project is to identify and analyze the cars in Washington State, which are electric and has the Clean Alternative fuel and is eligible to drive.
